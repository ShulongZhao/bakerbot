# bakerbot

Bakerbot is a Discord bot written in Python. Originally made as a learning exercise, now used by friends as a *somewhat* useful bot and used by me to experiment with dumb ideas.

## Prerequisites
Python (preferably not the snake variety).
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You'll also need a `keychain.py` file formatted like so:
```py
DISCORD_TOKEN = "YOUR DISCORD TOKEN HERE"
```
