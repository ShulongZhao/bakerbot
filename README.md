# YunYutility
YunYutility is a [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) bot written in Python :) Originally a copy of [Bakerbot](https://github.com/larrabyte/bakerbot) for me to learn coding.

## Prerequisites and Execution

Once all the prerequisites are installed, create a `secrets.json` file and format it like so:
```json
{
    "discord-token": "YOUR DISCORD TOKEN HERE",
}
```

Then run `yunyutility.bat`. Simple as that!
