# yunyutility
YunYutility is a Discord bot made with code stolen from Bakerbot. I literally don't know how to code and I just use it to do stuff like make embeds on discord.

## Prerequisites
Python.
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You'll also need a `keychain.py` file with the following structure:
```py
DISCORD_TOKEN: str
DEBUG_GUILD: int
POSTGRES_URL: str
```
